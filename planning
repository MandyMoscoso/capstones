BFFs
This project has 3 main functions: BE FIT – BE FULL and BE FINE, hence the name BFFs.
The project will use Google Maps API to show the nearest location to user’s location:
	BE FIT: nearest hiking trails.
	BE FULL: nearest restaurants.
	BE FINE: nearest pharmacies or hospitals.
The app will only return locations that is currently operational. User have an option to choose if they want to show all opening locations or only the one that currently open.
The app also provides a log in and sign-up function. Users can add locations to their personal lists. The info will be stored on an SQL database server.
